# 🌍 Global Testing Practices

This project collects insights on how **software testing is practiced around the world** — cultural traits, common tools, 
methodologies, challenges, and unique approaches. The goal is to build a knowledge base that highlights 
**regional differences** and **shared patterns** in the global QA community.

## What is expected from participants?

What they find being done differently in different countries or by different communities. Some samples (please note: 
these are only examples to show the expected style, not fixed contexts):

* I am Japanese and live in Japan. When working with foreign testers in my company, I found it interesting that they didn’t rely
on formal test cases. Instead, they used their own notes and code comments as guidance for testing.

* I am French and live in France. By attending international conferences, I have observed various testing methodologies shaped 
by different cultures. I feel that the French approach stands out in its structured use of formal test cases compared to others.

* I am Brazilian and moved to the US four years ago. I realized that the testing culture in the US differs from Brazil. In my view,
the US approach emphasizes "just getting things to work," while the Brazilian approach puts stronger focus on "just testing."
