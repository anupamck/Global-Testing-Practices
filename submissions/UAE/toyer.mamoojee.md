## üá¶üá™ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
I initially started my career in South Africa where I worked across 2 different cities there. I have found the following there during my 15 years of testing there:

-at the time many organizations focused on building Test Center of excellence between 2010 and around 2016. This then changed slightly as many saw benefits of decentralised teams and rise of Agile
-an even split between individuals in QA and Testing who were really proactive and others who were reactive. But this is probably similar in most locations
-in many organizations QAs started moving swiftly to becoming more and more technical and thus Test Automation was always are the heart of what QAs did.
-QAs also had a DevOps mindset and were very good all round contributors

In the UAE over the last 6 years, I have seen the following:
-Later shift to more decentralized teams, however faster up-skilling and adoption by QAs to adapt to this changing reality
-Very diverse individuals and opportunity to work with many different cultures
-QAs initially started of very traditional, with more documentation and traditional methods, but this has changed rapidly to more focus on output and more modern techniques to testing
-Some testing is still outsourced to other locations in the world (depending on organization)
-Growing test community, with much more engagement and representation across the world"

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
  In South Africa and now recently in UAE- I would say its on par with the world and modern trends including AI adoption as there are many active members in the testing community in both countries.
    
Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
  In South Africa and UAE I was surprised to see how quickly some individuals adopted certain practices and technical aspects.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
South Africa:
Strengths:
-Some active Global Test Community members who drive adoption and mindset across SA. As its a close knit testing community
-High education and training level means that many individuals hit the ground running and are super keen to make a difference
-Diverse testing community who are driven to make an impact locally and globally
-Shift left mindset already embedded in individuals, making them push in quality earlier

Weaknesses:
-Untapped market probably due to location (south of the world :)), which means many great talented individuals might be overlooked and not hired by international companies. Talent stays only within SA boundaries

UAE:
Strengths:
-Diverse individuals , coming from around the world. This brings many different ideas and trending practices
-The country itself is very creative and innovative as it leads technology adoption in general, this same quality is evident in the workforce and testing community too
-Balance of individuals with Technical and Business mindset

Weaknesses:
-Cannot think of any currently
