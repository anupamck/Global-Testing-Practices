## 🇵🇭 Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
  This can be quite controversial since in the Philippines, we have several 3rd party companies that offer QA services to other 
  companies. This can make someone assume that the testing culture in the Philippines is not really focused on or is really 
  underestimated. Tech companies sometimes do not feel the need to hire internal QAs because of the stigma surrounding testing 
  and it being a cause of delay for some.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- No observations
    
Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
  It's not really surprising but more on it being a sad thought that some companies still have their old ways of testing, 
  especially for large organizations. Which is where the advantage of startups with an agile environment comes.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
  Strength: Filipinos are very diligent and highly dedicated
  Weaknesses: Most are people-pleasers who are being taken advantage of. They can't say no and can't establish boundaries because they want to please everyone to cultivate a "harmonious" workspace.
