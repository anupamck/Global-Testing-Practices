## 🇩🇪 Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
  I have worked in Germany only. So there is nothing to compare to. Also, i have worked in start ups - and there each is unique.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
  i worked mostly in Germany. And mostly in start ups. So it is really hard to say what is specific here. Each start up had it's own ways of testing.
