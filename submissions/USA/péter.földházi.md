## üá∫üá∏ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
  I was working in Hungary for 10 years before moving to the USA where I've been living now for 6 years.

  In Hungary the focus is more on the details, and crisp engineering skills. As a Test Automation Engineer, I required strong Testing, Coding and Automation skills and experience to succeed. Usually, my work was heavily engineering focused or leading smaller teams.

  In the Unites States, the focus is more on coding as a Test Automation Engineer, and less on wide arrange of skills with deep expertise.
  As an Architect, I still rely heavily on my engineering experience and still being a hands-on coder. The main difference is client centricity, how to engage with new prospective clients, and build trust through successful delivery. Management style seems to be more flexible compared to Hungary, but that also means expecting timely delivery even if that means extra hours.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
  In Hungary, having a wider yet deep knowledge in all aspects is important, whereas in the States the deeper knowledge in one skill is more typical for engineers.

  For Architects it seems that in both countries people pick up the wide and deep expertise, so that is very similar. The rout is different, but the end goal is the same.

  The main difference is being closer to key client stakeholders. Many of the bigger projects are US based, therefore Architects usually have more CSM (Customer Success Manager) or DM (Delivery Manager) responsibilities in the US compared to Hungary.
    
Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
  I was surprised that in the US companies put more emphasis on coding, kinda handling Test Automation Engineers as Developers, i.e. SDETs.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- Hungary  
  * Strength: really skilled, smart engineers, who want to deliver results relentlessly.
  * Weakness: too much passion also means getting triggered easily by things that you should just ignore, or at least not let it waste your time.
- USA
  * Strength: Excellent communication and being able to articulate one's achievements and value they provide.
  * Weakness: The average tester has poor coding knowledge (which is surprising to see as the interviews are so much focused on coding).
