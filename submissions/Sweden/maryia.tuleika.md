## üá∏üá™ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- Belarus: I started my career in Belarus where I worked for 3 years.
    * strong hierarchy
    * strict environments with a lot of focus on authoritative leadership style and control
    * working hours tend to start later than in Europe (starting working day 10 am or later is fine)
    * no work-life balance (family is down-prioritized compared to work)
    * it's a common thing to get contacted from work outside working hours

- Sweden: After moving to Sweden 11 years ago I noticed quite a difference in working culture.
    * strong focus on work-life balance (family is always first prio, no work communication outside working hours)
    * flat hierarchy
    * working hours tend to start quite early and normal range to start the day is 7-9am
    * a lot of freedom to make make what you believe in and have an impact
    * it's common that teams and leaders struggle to take responsibility for a decision
    * friendly (but slightly distanced) communication style dominates 

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- No observations
    
Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
- A lot of so called manual testing focus in Belarus, compared to Sweden, where almost every tester has test automation skills. 
  In Sweden, it is called technical testing, i.e. with broad technical expertise. Everyone has some kind of test automation experience.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- Sweden  
    * Strength
        - friendly communication
        - flat hierarchy
        - a lot of autonomy
  * Weakness: a lack of structure sometimes results in not following processes or non-existence of processes at all.
