## üáØüáµ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- Turkey: Per my observation, In Turkey, dedicated QA teams were more dominant compared to integrated QA teams. 
- Japan: Japan's testing characteristics follow their culture.
    * Act as a team and Emphasis on group harmony, no strong individualism
    * Respect for hierarchy, managers or leaders are sometimes chosen from the oldest and they have strong impact on others
    * Communication might be slow since people do not say "no". they prefer to keep quiet or just disappear, so the other side may be waiting for nothing.
    * Process-oriented and disciplined: doing things the right way, not just doing them fast. Sometimes things which look trivial may be taking too much time.
    * Slow adoption of automation and agile ‚Äì change takes time due to strong reliance on established processes.           
    * Attention to detail and thoroughness
    * Manual testing dominance over test automation
    * Risk aversion ‚Äì a preference for proven methods rather than experimentation with new tools or practices.
    * High customer focus (as in all sectors) ‚Äì quality is seen as protecting the company‚Äôs reputation; defects are taken very seriously. (zero bug policy)
    * Integration with the international community is a bit blocked by language barrier  

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- No observations
    
Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
- In Japan, I was surprised to see how people advocating test planning and test design. Nowadays, everyone just tries
  to finish the minimum set and have an opinion about ready-to-go decision as soon as possible. Here, I saw people not
  too much caring about automation, but making test plans and test scenarios.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- Turkey  
  * Strength: Turkish people are highly dedicated and hardworking, with solid technical skills.
  * Weakness: The same flexibility that enables quick wins can sometimes lead to skipping proper procedures, creating the risk of disorganized or inconsistent outcomes.
- Japan
  * Strength: Extreme attention to detail and process discipline, resulting in very high-quality, reliable software.
  * Weakness: Rigid hierarchy and strict adherence to procedures can slow innovation and make adoption of automation or agile practices slower.
