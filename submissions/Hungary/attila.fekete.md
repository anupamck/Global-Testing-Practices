## üá≠üá∫ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- [Thanks to the local ISTQB chapter, the Hungarian Testing Board, as well as our very own international testing conference and regular community meetups, the testing culture in Hungary is quite mature. Hungarian testers are typically pragmatic and technically skilled, with solid knowledge of both programming and testing principles. They tend to keep up with the latest trends and apply them in practice. Known for being hardworking and committed to high quality standards, testers are recognized as a dedicated role across all companies. In addition, Hungary has produced quite a few internationally recognized experts who contribute actively to the global testing community.]

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- [When I worked in Greece a long time ago, testing was just like everything else there ‚Äî unpredictable, unreliable, more about just getting the stuff out the door than about quality.

In Hungary, at multinational companies, testing maturity is pretty much the same as in Western Europe ‚Äî I worked a lot in Sweden, and I see very similar practices. Testing is structured, pragmatic, thorough, state of the art, and the dedicated tester role exists. In Sweden testing is absolute top notch, testers are pragmatic and well-trained.

On the other hand, at local companies and on the government side in Hungary, it is still more ad-hoc, and people‚Äôs skills might not be fully up to international standards.

At the same time, cultural differences play a role too. US folks tend to oversell, while Hungarians often undersell themselves. Hungarians usually wait until they have something solid before speaking up, while Americans are often the opposite ‚Äî talking even when there‚Äôs not much to say. Hungarians can be very innovative, but often keep their ideas to themselves until they are fully ready. In contrast, US folks are quick to market even tiny ideas, or sometimes even repackage existing ones as brand-new innovations.]

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
- [In Greece I am surprised how companies can survive with this attitude, however since I have worked there a lot might have changed.]

What are the biggests strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- [Strength: very technical, skilled, very pragmatic, innovative]
- [Weakness: low self-confidence, probably slightly worse communication and presentations skills and self-management ]
